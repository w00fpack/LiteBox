LiteBox is a tiny application to turn your display into a lightbox.  With a lightbox, you can do things such as:
* View negatives and film
* Trace images that are on your display

## Requirements

# Quickstart

## Film viewing

After starting LiteBox, place some film on your display.  The white backlight will make your film more easily viewable

## Tracing

After starting LiteBox, place an object to trace on top of your display.  Trace the object with a pencil.  Do not press down hard, since you are tracing on your monitor's glass
